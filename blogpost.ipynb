    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we reproduce the fourth column of Table 1 from the paper [**Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158v2.pdf). The code has been created following the paper with gaps \n",
    "filled in by ourselves.\n",
    "The paper presents a convolutional neural network capable of real-time Super-Resolution (SR).\n",
    "They designed a CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the Low-Resolution(LR) space \n",
    "and introducing an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale\n",
    "the final LR feature maps into the High-Resolution(HR) output.\n",
    "A researcher would like a reproduction of this to test on his high-res dataset.\n",

    "### ESPCN\n",
    "For the problem of single image super-resolution (SISR), the authors of this paper set out to improve the network known as SRCN, discussed in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7115171). SRCNN approaches the problem by increasing the resolution of the LR image before the first layer of the network. The authors argue this is inefficient since the processing speed of convolutional networks directly depends on the resolution of the input image. Therefore they propose a faster network called ESPCN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new architecture improves this by increasing the resolution from LR to HR only at the very end of the network and super-resolves HR data from LR feature maps, by first applying a multi-layer CNN directly to LR image and then applying a sub-pixel convolution layer that upscales the LR feature maps to produce the SR output image.  Figure 1 (retrieved from [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158v2.pdf)) shows a visualisation of the network, the rest of this section is dedicated to the mathematical description of the network.\n",

    "![figure 1](rsc/ESPCN.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a network composed of L layers, $n_{L-1}$ upscaling filters for the $n_{L-1}$ feature maps are learned. The first L−1 layers can be described as follows:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$f^1(\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR};W_1, b_1)= \\phi (W_1 \\ast \\boldsymbol{I}^{LR}+b_1)$  \n",
    "$f^l(\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR};W_{1:l}, b_{1:l})= \\phi (W_1 \\ast f^{l-1}(\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR})+b_l)$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Where $W_l , b_l , l \\in (1, L - 1)$ are learnable network weights and biases respectively.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$W_l$ is a 2D convolution tensor of size $n_{l-1} \\times n_l \\times k_l \\times k_l$ , where $n_l$ is the number of \n",
    "features at layer $l$, $n_0 = C$, and $k_l$ is the filter size at layer $l$.  \n",
    "The biases $b_l$ are vectors of length $n_l$ . The nonlinearity function (or activation function) $\\phi$ is applied \n",
    "element-wise and is fixed. The last layer $f^L$ converts the LR feature maps to an HR image $\\boldsymbol{I}^{SR}$.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The last layer is an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer. The authors propose a convolution with stride $\\frac{1}{r}$ in de LR space with a filter $W_s$ of size $k_s$ with a weight spacing $\\frac{1}{r}$. This way, each activation pattern is periodically activated during the convolution of the filter depending on different sub-pixel locations. A way to implement this can be described in the following way:  \n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{I}^{SR}=f^L (\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR}) = \\mathcal{PS} (W_L \\ast f^{L-1} (\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR}) + b_L)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "Where $\\mathcal{PS}$ is an periodic shuffling operator that rearranges the elements of a $H \\times W \\times C \\cdot r^2$ tensor to a tensor of shape $rH \\times rW \\times C$. \n",
    "The periodic shuffle can be denoted as follows:\n",
    "$\\mathcal{PS} (T)_{x,y,c} = T_{\\lfloor x/r \\rfloor, \\lfloor y/r \\rfloor , C\\cdot r \\cdot mod(y,r) + C\\cdot mod(x,r) + c}$.\n",
    "The convolution operator $W_L$ thus has shape $n_{L - 1} \\times C \\cdot r^2 \\times k_L \\times k_L$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed network can be referred to as an efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network, also referred to as *ESPCN*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A pixel-wise mean squared error function is used to train the network:\n",
    "$\\ell(W_{1:L}, b_{1:L}) = \\frac{1}{r^2HW}\\sum^{rH}_{x=1}\\sum^{rW}_{x=1} (\\boldsymbol{I}^{HR}_{x,y} - f^L_{x,y}(\\boldsymbol{I}^{LR}))^2$.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "To increase the performance while learning the periodic shuffling at the end can be avoided during training since the labelled training data can be inversely shuffled to match the output of the last layer before it is shuffled, therefore avoiding unnecessary calculations.\n",

    "## Experiment Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducing the results consists of two main steps, namely:  \n",
    "1. generating the training data\n",
    "2. training the network on said data  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these steps are discussed below individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Generating the training data\n",
    "Since the T91 data set only consists of 91 images, the images need to be transformed in various ways to generate a sufficient amount of training data. Three steps are applied to the T91 data set in order to generate the training data.\n",
    "1. A gaussian blur (sigma \\= \\[$0.1$ - $1$\\]) is applied to the original images to simulate optical blur of a low-resolution camera and the images are downscaled by a factor $3$.\n",
    "2. $17$ by $17$ training images are subsampled from the downscaled images, corresponding to $17r$ by $17r$ pixel subsamples of the original HR images\n",
    "3. An inverse periodic shuffle is applied on the $17r$ by $17r$ pixel subsamples of original HR images to obtain training data labels\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure 2](rsc/ss_hr_to_lr.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Training the network\n",
    "Once the training data is generated we can begin training. The model is trained to predict the inverse shuffled HR subsamples from the corresponding blurred LR subsamples. To reproduce the original paper as accurately as possible, the exact implementation details from their paper were implemented. However, some of the information necessary for reproducing these results was missing. This missing information and our approach are detailed further in *Discussion*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "From the losses shown in the figure below we can conclude that our network is able to learn on the generated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure 3](rsc/train_and_test_loss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After training for approximately 3000 epochs, we achieved the results in the *Our ESPCN* column:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Set | Scale | Bi-cubic | SRCNN (91)| Paper ESPCN | Our ESPCN |\n",

    "\n",
    "The results are similar to the *Paper ESPCN*, but since our model is not an improvement over *SRCNN* we do not feel that we were able to reproduce the results from the paper. The reason why we were unable to reproduce the results and our approach to optimizing our own results are discussed in *Discussion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "We did not manage to reproduce the results from Table 1 from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158v2.pdf), column ESPCN (91). When trying to recreate the results of the paper, we recreated the model as described in the paper. However, some hyperparameters and architectural decisions were not given. The following information was missing from the paper and made it harder to reproduce the results:\n",
    "* **Optimizer**: It is not stated what optimizer is used when training the network.\n",
    "* **How the learning rate changes from high to low**: It is not stated how the learning rate changes between its start- and end-value. A parameter ‘mu’ is mentioned, where the learning rate decreases with an unknown amount when the improvement is smaller than ‘mu’. However, the value of ‘mu’ is not given.\n",
    "* **Gaussian blur**: To simulate the downscale image when training in a realistic manner, the training images are blurred. However, the intensity of this blur is not given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find optimal values for these parameters, we export the values of these parameters and their respective results to a *.csv* file after each training session. This allowed us to easily run the training multiple times with different parameter sets and compare their respective results. Though we were able to optimize our network by finding better parameters, we were still unable to reproduce the results from the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing and training *ESPCN* we encountered a few other parameters that were not necessarily missing from the paper, but would have been beneficial to have more information on, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch size**: The batch size was not given, nor was it clear from the paper whether batches were used at all. This information would have been useful to interpret their training times and compare them to ours.\n",
    "* **Model validation**: The T91 dataset was used for training. However, it was not specified whether this dataset was split up into a train, test and validation set. Was (k-fold) cross-validation used, was some other validation method used or did they train on the full dataset without validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen parameters values\n",
    "After experimenting with multiple runs these were the observations we made w.r.t. the impact and optimal values of the missing (hyper)parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Optimizer__: Adam is used instead of SGD as proposed in the paper. For SGD the results obtained with the high-level description in the paper were far below the results in the paper - SGD needs to be fine-tuned so it is important the paper should have mentioned the specific parameters and method. The adam optimizer works in a similar way but the only parameter to be set is the final learning rate which is set to $1e-4$ as in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Gaussian blur sigma__: values between $0$ and $2$ were tried for the gaussian sigma, with values between $0.25$ and $1$ showing similar performance, a sigma of $1$ achieved the highest performance which is used for our final reproduction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __no-learning threshold__ of $1e-7$ is chosen meaning the training stops after $100$ epochs where the max improvement per epoch is below this threshold. Choosing a higher threshold causes the training process to end with suboptimal results and experiments run with a smaller threshold did not finish within a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __batch size__ of $10$ was chosen to speed up training. Using lower batch sizes (below $4$) considerably increased the training time and much higher batch sizes (e.g. $50$, $100$) resulted in a higher loss while training.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __train/test split__ is not mentioned by the paper, we tried splits $70$-$30$, $80$-$20$, $90$-$10$ with the $90$-$10$ split giving the best PSNR.\n",
